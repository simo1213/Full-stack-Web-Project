This project is part of my learning journey through The Web Developer  on Udemy.
The course covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and more, with a strong focus on building real-world, full-stack web applications.

Throughout the course, I learned how to:

Write clean and efficient JavaScript, mastering variables, functions, loops, and objects
Work with Node.js and Express to create server-side applications
Use MongoDB for database management and integrate it into full-stack projects
Develop single-page applications (SPAs) with React and modern tooling like Vite

This repository contains projects and exercises from the course, demonstrating:
Frontend development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React
